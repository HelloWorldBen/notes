Errors
Its possible to program the robots wrong - depends on severity -degree of problem 
correct error cannot happen again same thing cannot be said of human beings
Security - Putting clear text credentials into scripts
server logs need to be encrypted - business user might share info 
credentials etc
System overload - Robots generate more volume than humans - 24 /7 work
robot can generate downstream alot of data 
Redundancy - Once humans who used to know the manual process are gone, who can 
help in case of robot failure - mitigate execellent documentation around process robot
developers can use that as resource when things go wrong
RPA lock in
beware of proprietary RPA tools locked in depend on their tools - onboard custom tools 
to have freedom
